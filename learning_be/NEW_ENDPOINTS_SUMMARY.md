# New Course Filtering Endpoints - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Feature Overview

Added two new API endpoints that filter courses based on the current user's enrollment status:

1. **My Enrolled Courses** - `/api/courses/my-enrolled`
2. **Available Courses** - `/api/courses/available`

## ðŸš€ API Endpoints

### 1. My Enrolled Courses
```http
GET /api/courses/my-enrolled
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

**Purpose:** Returns only courses the authenticated user is enrolled in.

**Features:**
- âœ… Supports all standard filters: `language_id`, `difficulty`, `search`, `per_page`
- âœ… Pagination support
- âœ… All courses have `is_enrolled: true`
- âœ… All courses include full enrollment details with GitHub repo info

**Response Example:**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "My enrolled courses retrieved successfully",
    "data": {
        "data": [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "title": "JavaScript Fundamentals",
                "is_enrolled": true,
                "enrollment": {
                    "id": 5,
                    "status": "active",
                    "github_repository_url": "https://github.com/student/js-project",
                    "code_quality_score": 87.5,
                    "enrolled_at": "2025-06-21T10:30:00.000000Z"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### 2. Available Courses (Not Enrolled)
```http
GET /api/courses/available
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

**Purpose:** Returns only courses the authenticated user is NOT enrolled in.

**Features:**
- âœ… Supports all standard filters: `language_id`, `difficulty`, `search`, `per_page`
- âœ… Pagination support
- âœ… All courses have `is_enrolled: false`
- âœ… All courses have `enrollment: null`

**Response Example:**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Available courses retrieved successfully",
    "data": {
        "data": [
            {
                "id": 2,
                "title": "Advanced JavaScript",
                "is_enrolled": false,
                "enrollment": null
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

### Controller Methods
- `CourseController::myEnrolledCourses()` - Uses `whereHas('enrollments')`
- `CourseController::availableCourses()` - Uses `whereDoesntHave('enrollments')`

### Route Registration
```php
Route::get('courses/my-enrolled', [CourseController::class, 'myEnrolledCourses']);
Route::get('courses/available', [CourseController::class, 'availableCourses']);
```

**Note:** These routes are placed BEFORE the resource routes to prevent conflicts.

### Database Queries
**Enrolled Courses:**
```php
Course::whereHas('enrollments', function ($q) use ($userId) {
    $q->where('user_id', $userId);
})
```

**Available Courses:**
```php
Course::whereDoesntHave('enrollments', function ($q) use ($userId) {
    $q->where('user_id', $userId);
})
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Verification

### Postman Collection Updates
- âœ… Added "My Enrolled Courses" request with validation tests
- âœ… Added "Available Courses" request with validation tests
- âœ… Added comprehensive test scripts that verify enrollment status
- âœ… Added verification endpoints in "Verification & Testing" section

### Test Coverage
- âœ… Validates all enrolled courses have `is_enrolled: true`
- âœ… Validates all available courses have `is_enrolled: false`
- âœ… Verifies no overlap between the two endpoints
- âœ… Tests filtering and pagination functionality

### Manual Testing Results
```
âœ… Set up test data:
   - Enrolled in: Introduction to JavaScript
   - NOT enrolled in: Test JavaScript Course
   
âœ… Found 1 enrolled courses:
   - Introduction to JavaScript (enrollment ID: 2)
   
âœ… Found 1 available courses:
   - Test JavaScript Course (not enrolled)
   
âœ… Verification:
   - First course in enrolled: YES
   - Second course in available: YES
   - No overlap between lists: YES
```

## ðŸ“š Documentation Updates

### API Documentation
- âœ… Added detailed endpoint descriptions
- âœ… Included request/response examples
- âœ… Documented filtering capabilities

### Testing Guide
- âœ… Updated testing workflow to include new endpoints
- âœ… Added validation steps for enrollment filtering

## ðŸŽ‰ Benefits

1. **Better UX:** Frontend can easily show "My Courses" and "Browse Courses" sections
2. **Performance:** Filtered queries are more efficient than client-side filtering
3. **Consistency:** All existing filters (language, difficulty, search) work with new endpoints
4. **Flexibility:** Standard pagination and response format maintained

## ðŸš€ Ready to Use

The feature is **fully implemented and tested**. The Laravel server is running on `http://localhost:8000` and all endpoints are ready for integration with frontend applications.

Use the provided Postman collection to test the endpoints, or integrate directly into your frontend application!
