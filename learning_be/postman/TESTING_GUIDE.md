# Postman Testing Guide - Laravel Learning Platform with CodeRabbit

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Import Collections and Environment

1. **Import the Postman Collection:**
   - Open Postman
   - Click "Import" 
   - Select `postman/Laravel_Learning_Platform_CodeRabbit.postman_collection.json`

2. **Import the Environment:**
   - Click "Import" again
   - Select `postman/Laravel_Learning_Platform_Local.postman_environment.json`
   - Set this as your active environment

### 2. Server Setup

Make sure your Laravel server is running:
```bash
cd "d:\Proiect invatare\learning_be"
php artisan serve
```

Your API will be available at: `http://localhost:8000`

## Complete Testing Workflow

### Phase 1: Authentication & User Setup

1. **Register User** 
   - Creates a new student account
   - Use provided JSON payload or customize as needed
   - **Auto-saves:** Nothing (manual test)

2. **Login User**
   - Authenticates and gets access token
   - **Auto-saves:** `AUTH_TOKEN` and `USER_ID` to environment
   - ‚úÖ **Critical:** This must work for all other tests

3. **Get Profile**
   - Verifies authentication is working
   - Should return user details including avatar field

### Phase 2: Course Management

4. **List Courses**
   - Shows all courses with enrollment information
   - **Tests:** Verifies `is_enrolled` and `enrollment` fields are present
   - Shows mixed enrolled/not enrolled status

5. **My Enrolled Courses**
   - Shows only courses the user is enrolled in
   - **Tests:** All courses should have `is_enrolled: true`
   - **Tests:** All courses should have enrollment details

6. **Available Courses (Not Enrolled)**
   - Shows only courses the user is NOT enrolled in
   - **Tests:** All courses should have `is_enrolled: false`
   - **Tests:** All courses should have `enrollment: null`

7. **Create Course**
   - Creates a test course for enrollment
   - **Auto-saves:** `COURSE_ID` to environment
   - Note: User must have "teacher" role or modify validation

8. **Get Course**
   - Retrieves single course details
   - **Tests:** Verifies enrollment information is included

### Phase 3: Enrollment & GitHub Integration

9. **Enroll in Course**
   - Enrolls authenticated user in the course
   - **Auto-saves:** `ENROLLMENT_ID` to environment
   - ‚úÖ **Critical:** This ID is used for all GitHub/CodeRabbit tests

10. **List My Enrollments**
    - Shows user's enrollments
    - Verify the new enrollment appears

11. **Get Enrollment Details**
    - Shows detailed enrollment info
    - Should show GitHub fields as null initially

12. **Assign GitHub Repository**
    - **‚≠ê KEY FEATURE:** Links GitHub repo to enrollment
    - Updates `github_repository_url` and `github_repository_name`
    - Verify response shows updated GitHub fields

13. **Update Enrollment Status**
    - Changes status to "active", "completed", etc.
    - Test different status values

### Phase 4: CodeRabbit Integration Testing

14. **Trigger Code Analysis** (Method 1)
    - **‚≠ê KEY FEATURE:** Triggers CodeRabbit analysis for the enrollment
    - Requires GitHub repository to be assigned first
    - Tests the main CodeRabbit integration endpoint

15. **Manual Trigger Analysis** (Method 2)
    - Alternative endpoint for triggering analysis
    - Uses different route structure
    - Good for testing different approaches

16. **Update Code Analysis Results (Manual)**
    - **‚≠ê TESTING FEATURE:** Manually sets analysis results
    - Uses comprehensive test data with issues, metrics, and scores
    - Simulates what CodeRabbit webhook would do
    - Verify quality score calculation

17. **CodeRabbit Webhook (Simulate)**
    - **‚≠ê KEY FEATURE:** Simulates CodeRabbit sending analysis results
    - Tests webhook endpoint security and processing
    - Includes realistic analysis data structure
    - Note: Signature validation may be disabled for testing

### Phase 5: Verification

18. **Get Updated Enrollment (After Analysis)**
    - **‚≠ê VERIFICATION:** Check that analysis data was stored
    - Should show:
      - `code_analysis_data` with issues and metrics
      - `code_quality_score` calculated value
      - `last_analysis_at` timestamp
      - GitHub repository information

19. **List Programming Languages**
    - Utility endpoint for reference data
    - Useful for creating courses

20. **Complete Enrollment**
    - Sets enrollment status to "completed"
    - Final workflow step

## Key Testing Scenarios

### üéØ Happy Path Test
1. Register ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Create Course ‚Üí Enroll ‚Üí Assign GitHub ‚Üí Trigger Analysis ‚Üí Verify Results

### üîç Error Scenarios to Test

**Authentication Errors:**
- Try accessing protected endpoints without token
- Use invalid/expired token

**GitHub Assignment Errors:**
- Try to assign repository to someone else's enrollment
- Use invalid GitHub URL format
- Missing required fields

**CodeRabbit Analysis Errors:**
- Trigger analysis without GitHub repository assigned
- Invalid enrollment ID
- Malformed webhook data

**Authorization Errors:**
- Try to access other users' enrollments
- Cross-user data access attempts

## Expected Data Flow

```
1. User enrolls in course
   ‚Üì
2. User assigns GitHub repository URL
   ‚Üì  
3. System triggers CodeRabbit analysis
   ‚Üì
4. CodeRabbit analyzes repository
   ‚Üì
5. CodeRabbit sends results via webhook
   ‚Üì
6. System stores analysis data and calculates quality score
   ‚Üì
7. Student/Teacher can view code quality metrics
```

## Important Test Data

### Sample GitHub URLs (for testing)
- `https://github.com/student/javascript-fundamentals-project`
- `https://github.com/username/react-todo-app`
- `https://github.com/developer/node-api-project`

### Expected Quality Scores
- High quality (few issues): 85-100
- Medium quality (some issues): 60-85  
- Low quality (many issues): 0-60

### Analysis Data Structure
The system stores comprehensive analysis data including:
- **Issues:** bugs, security vulnerabilities, code smells
- **Metrics:** lines of code, complexity, test coverage
- **Scores:** maintainability index, technical debt ratio
- **Summary:** issue counts by severity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **401 Unauthorized**
   - Check AUTH_TOKEN is set in environment
   - Re-run login request if token expired

2. **422 Validation Error** 
   - Check required fields in request body
   - Verify data types match API expectations

3. **403 Forbidden**
   - User trying to access resources they don't own
   - Check user permissions/roles

4. **404 Not Found**
   - Invalid ID in URL path
   - Check environment variables are set correctly

5. **500 Server Error**
   - Check Laravel logs: `tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log`
   - Database connection issues
   - Missing configuration

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Environment Variables:**
   - Verify all auto-saved IDs (USER_ID, COURSE_ID, ENROLLMENT_ID)
   - Confirm BASE_URL points to running server

2. **Verify Database:**
   - Check enrollments table has GitHub fields
   - Confirm migrations ran successfully
   - Verify foreign key relationships

3. **Test Individual Components:**
   - Start with authentication
   - Test each feature incrementally
   - Don't skip to advanced features without basics working

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Complete Success:** All requests return expected status codes and data
‚úÖ **GitHub Integration:** Repository successfully assigned and stored
‚úÖ **CodeRabbit Simulation:** Analysis data properly processed and quality score calculated
‚úÖ **Data Persistence:** All data retrievable in subsequent requests

This comprehensive test suite validates the entire GitHub + CodeRabbit integration workflow!
